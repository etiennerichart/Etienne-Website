        <p>This issue was first reported by BrianJian on bpython's <a
                href="https://github.com/bpython/bpython/issues/806"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> issues page</a>. BrianJian found that his computer
            would start using a lot of its CPU when opening up. After some discussion it was believed that this was a
            result of the program encountering symbolic links that would result in it becoming stuck in loops when it
            searched for modules to import.

        <p>This first part of the code looks at each file and directory in the path and checks to see if they are a
            package. This part also assigns for where to look for submodules. The second part of the code, shown below,
            adds more path for the program to look at and finally returns the curent path. This second part is where the
            recursion happens and I needed to find a fix.

    <section class="two">
        <h3 class="simpleh3">Setting up the Test</h3>
        <p>To better diagnose the issue I started out by creating a folder loop through the terminal. I did this using
            the <kbd>mkdir fileName</kbd>
            command in the terminal. After having a long enough chain of folders I created a final folder symbolically
            linked to my first folder with
            the command <kbd>ln -s firstFolderPath finalFolderPath</kbd> in my case I wrote: 
            <kbd>ln -s ~/bpython/importtestfolder/Level0/Level1
                ~/bpython/importtestfolder/Level0/Level1/Level2/Level3</kbd>
        </p>
        <div><img class="fileTree" src="TestFolder1.png" alt="MyFileTree" /></div>
    </section>

    <section class="three">
        <h3 class="simpleh3">My First two Ideas</h3>
        <p>Starting out I wanted to use the subname variable to let me know if we had encountered a path before. The
            subname variable is a String of the relative path that separates each folder by a '.' . We could possibly
            tell if we were in a loop by watching for repetion like Level0.Level1.Level2.Level3.Level2 in the subname.
            To make this simple I used <code>re.split(".", subname)</code>. This returns a list of each folder that I
            could iterate over to find repeated names. The problem with this method was that you would get pretty far
            along before checking.
        </p>
        <p>To avoid this I looked at the pathname variable. This opperates a lot like the subname variable except that
            the path was '/' seperated. As I kept on working I felt that simple pattern recognition was not good enough
            to recognize if the program had entered a loop as there could be multiple files in the same path with the
            same name. As such I did som more research and came up with my current method.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="four">
        <h3 class="simpleh3">The Current Solution</h3>
        <p>My current method consits of using the <code>os.path.realpath(path)</code> function. This returns a path with
            the symbolic links collapsed. For example <code>os.path.realpath('Level0.Level1.Level2.Level3')</code>
            would return Level0.Level1 as its result. To best use this I created a variable, <code><var>paths</var></code> , outside the
            function that acts as a global variable and stores each path that has been encountered in a set. Storing in
            a set makes checking the set for the path faster as sets use hashing to store the paths whereas using a list
            would require traversing the entire list. The second part of the find_modules function now look like this:
        </p>

                <span class="purple">else</span>:
                    <span class="purple">if</span> is_package:
                        path_real = os.path.realpath(pathname)
                        <span class="purple">if</span> path_real <span class="blueT">not in</span> paths:
                            paths.add(path_real)
                            <span class="purple">for</span> subname <span class="purple">in</span> find_modules(pathname):
                                <span class="purple">if</span> subname != <span class="orange">"__init__"</span>:
                                    <span class="purple">yield</span> <span class="orange">"</span><span class="blueT">%s</span><span class="orange">.</span><span class="blueT">%s</span><span class="orange">"</span> % (name, subname)
                    <span class="purple">yield</span> name
        </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section class="five">
        <h3 class="simpleh3">Finalizing Testing</h3>
        <p>To further test my solution I thought of a new case where a folder on a Right branch links to a Left branch
            and a folder on the Left branch links to the Right branch creating a loop.
        </p>
        <div><img class="fileTreeTwo" src="TestFolder2.png" alt="MyFileTree2" /></div> <br />
        <p>Next I had to incorporate my testing into the bpython unittest files. As part the process I replaced my test
            folders with temporary ones that would be removed after the test had been run. This saves memory and keeps 
            my test confined to just the test file.
        </p>My first step to writing the test was setting up the temp files. In order to do this I used the tempfile module.
        Using a context manager for to ensure the cleanup after the test finishes running, I used the <code>tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()</code>
        to set up the filestructure as I described before. Still in the test setup I had the new and improved <code>find_modules()</code>
        run through the temporary directory and store a list of its output. Next, I created a list with the acceptable outputs 
        hardcoded.
        <p>
        <p>In the test I compared the stored outpput with the hardcoded list removing the hardcoded value if it matched any 
            store value. This ensure that there was no repetition and at the end I checked that the hardcoded list is empty 
            to ensure no file is skipped. On the surface this work well but, I came to learn that on other people's computer 
            the Left or Right file would not be accessed in the same order. In order to avoid this problem I had to add both 
            path options to the hardcoded list and remove a path option when the test ran based on which file first appeared.
