        <h3 class="simpleh3">The Idea:</h3>
        <p>I first came up with this idea while learning about ANSI escape codes and
            trying to write a program that would move the terminal cursor around to
            create things like a loading bar. I thought of using the terminal as a
            canvas to draw and update a visual that would represent the sound file
            playing along. Ansi escape codes used to create animations in the terminal
            similar to the spacy download bellow by <a href="https://github.com/ines/termynal"><i
                    class="fa fa-github"></i> termynal</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="simpleh3">Creating the Canvas</h3>
        <p>The first step in my project was to create a working canvas that would
            display and update correctly in the terminal. I started out by creating
            a program that would display a 80x24 rectangle of ']' that would randomly
            changes colors a hundred times.
        </p>
        <p>To do this I used the <kbd>u"\u001b[{n}A</kbd> escape code that moves the
            cursor up n rows, the <kbd>u"\u001b[{n}D"</kbd> that moves the cursor left
            n columns, and <kbd>u"\u001b[{30-37}m"</kbd> code that sets the text color
            to one of 8 different colors. Once the canvas finished displaying I used the
            <kbd>u"\u001b[0m"</kbd> to reset the terminal to its default settings.

        <h3 class="simpleh3">Adjusting the Canvas to the Terminal</h3>
        <p>To make sure the image in viewable I needed the canvas to adjust
            to the size of the terminal. To do this I had to find a way to
            get the terminal's size.
        </p>
        <p>A terminal is made of a certain amount of rows and columns. Each
            cell holding one character (as long as they are of standard width).
            After some research I found an easy way to get the number of rows
            and columns
            <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/566746/how-to-get-linux-console-window-width-in-python">here</a>.
            Using this code which returns the rows and columns as a String:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
        <span id="purple">import</span> os
        rows, columns = os.popen(<span id="orange">'stty size'</span>, <span id="orange"></span>'r'</span>).read().split()
    </code></pre>

        <p>With this I was able to initalize a table that fit inside the terminal
            without having the table wrap around if a hardcoded table had been bigger
            than the terminal.

        <h3 class="simpleh3">Reading a WAV File</h3>

        <p>Next I had to find a way to read a soundfile and ensure the visuals matched up.
            I decided to use the WAV file format and began to do some research. In the end
            I found three relevant sources. <a href="http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/">One</a>
            on the way WAV files are stored, another, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html">the docs</a>
            on the python wave module used to read wav file and a
            <a href="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/blog/reading-wave-python">third one</a> which detailed an
            example program using the wave module.
        </p>
        <p>From my first source I learned that the WAV file is a type of Microsoft's RIFF files written in three
            chunks:
        <div><img src="http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/wav-sound-format.gif"
                alt="Image of the RIFF file breakdown" />
        </div>
        When comparing the docs for the wave module with the different chuncks of the WAV format, I realized that I
        couldn't get all the information from the wave module. As a result I wrote my own <a
            href="https://github.com/etiennerichart/music-visualized-in-terminal/blob/master/wavParser.py">WAV
            parser</a>. At the beginning of writing the parser I struggled a lot with correctly converting bytes
        into letter or numbers with little or big endian. I started out using the <a
            href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html">struct</a> module. However, I soon learned about the
        int
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.from_bytes">class
            method</a>: <code>int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder, *, signed=False)</code>. This was much simpler in my
        opinion as I would not have to use different struct formatters based on the length of the bytes I would need to
        convert.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="five">
        <h3 class="simpleh3">Creating the Visual</h3>
        <p>Now that I had my parser working I began to work on creating a visual that would match my audio. I first
            tried to create a buffer that would preload a specified amout of data and process it so that every data
            point was represented. My mentor, <a href="http://ballingt.com/">Thomas Ballinger</a>, who was code
            reviewing my project proposed that I sample the WAV file in realtime using the wave module's
            <code>wave.setPos(target)</code> in order to avoid not being able to fit all the visualized data into the
            time frame of the audio. To compute the correct target he proposed I use the time module to get the amount
            of time the the file had been playing at each sampling point.
        </p>

        <p>This worked very well, and so my next step became to convert the data into a color ANSI Esc Code. To give
            myself some variety I used the <kbd>u"\u001b[48;5;{0-230}"</kbd> extended background colors. To get the
            widest range of colors I created a function at the start that would go through the document and get the max
            of the absolute value of the data. To visualize this process I drew from <a
                href="https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html">Build your own
                Command Line with ANSI escape codes</a>, which had first inspired me to do this project, to create a
            loading bar.

        <h3 class="simpleh3">A More Interesting Visual</h3>

        <p>Looking at my canvas changing from one color to another, I found that my visualization wasn't very
            interesting. As such I decide to create a ripple pattern starting at the center of the canvas. The
            centermost ripple would be the color of the current amplitude and move out as more recent amplitudes were
            sampled.
        </p>

        <p>In order to do this I created a second program, ripple.py which would take the canvas and return a grid
            with numbers to match the position of each ripple like this:
        <pre id="green">
#  1|1  2|1|2  2|2|2  2|2|2  2|2|2|2  2|2|2|2  3|2|2|2|3  3|2|2|2|3  3|2|2|2|2|3  2|1|1|2  4|3|2|1|1|2|3|4  4|3|2|2|2|2|3|4  
#  1|1  2|1|2  2|1|2  2|1|2  2|1|1|2  2|1|1|2  3|2|1|2|3  3|2|1|2|3  3|2|1|1|2|3  2|1|1|2  4|3|2|1|1|2|3|4  4|3|2|1|1|2|3|4  
#              2|2|2  2|1|2  2|2|2|2  2|1|1|2  3|2|1|2|3  3|2|2|2|3  3|2|2|2|2|3                            4|3|2|2|2|2|3|4  
#                     2|2|2           2|2|2|2  3|2|2|2|3

            </pre>

        <p>The easiest way I found of creating my pattern was to first create a larger square and the cut it down to
            size. If the columns were odd I would first remove one of the middle columns, if the rows were odd one of
            the middle rows. After that I would take off the outer two columns or rows until the grid matched my canvas'
            dimensions.
        </p>

        <p>With this done I created a list the size of the largest number by sampling the top left corner (<kbd>[0][0]</kbd>).
            During run time I could add the color of the newest amplitude to the list and pop of the last one.
        <pre><code><span id="blue">self</span>.ripples_color.pop()
<span id="blue">self</span>.ripples_color.insert(<span id="number">0</span>, <span id="blue">u</span><span id="orange">"\u001b[48;5;"</span> + <span id="lightgreen">str</span>(<span id="lightgreen">int</span>((amplitude.<span id="yellow">__next__</span>() / <span id="blue">self</span>.max) * <span id="number">230</span>)) + <span id="blue">u</span><span id="orange">"m"</span>)
        </code></pre>
        I would
        access each element of my canvas and based on the number received from the correlating grind cell I could
        assign it a color.
        <pre><code><span id="blue">self</span>.word <span id="lightblue"></span>= <span id="blue">self</span>.word + <span id="blue">self</span>.ripples_color[<span id="blue">self</span>.ripples[y][x] - <span id="number">1</span>] + <span id="orange">" "</span>
        </code></pre>

        <h3 class="simpleh3">Threading the Visual and Audio</h3>

        <p>My next goal was to get my audio and visual to play together. First, I needed to figure out how to play the
            audio on the MacOS, preferably without having to install any packages. I finally found
            <code>os.system("afplay " + WAVFile)</code> but then I realised that my program would wait for the audio to
            finish playing before displaying the visualization. In order to avoid this problem I had to place the
            visualization code on a <a href="https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/">thread</a>. Once that
            was done my audio and visual played in sync. Except, I now noticed a lag in my visualization. On a hunch
            that the threading was causing the visual lag, I made a <code>.join()</code> call on the thread after the
            music began playing so that the thread would stop switching back and forth with the main program, resolving
            the lag.
